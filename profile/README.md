## Blue Atomic

🙋‍♀️ We are a FOSS organization, aiming to fill the gaps in markets that lack FOSS software.
👀 Our initiative is to open the FOSS world up to more products, allowing everyone to contribute.
👩‍💻 We run fully on donations. We currently do not get any funds through commercial products.
