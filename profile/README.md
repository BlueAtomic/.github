Our mission at Wolfsvale is to provide the market with more FOSS products. We want to ensure that *everyone* gets a chance, and would like to offer these chances by filling the gaps on the market. We do not discriminate. We will make anything in our grasp for everyone in a cost-effective, yet effective manner. We will also always maintain the software we produce. Created by a software development student, Wolfsvale Software aims to learn, and to teach others. This way we can give the knowledge we have to others, and provide it in a meaningful way. We are a dutch company, and conform to the european laws. All our developers are volunteers.
